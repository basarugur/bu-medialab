#summary Responsive Workbench Project Design Document Draft 1
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

We want the code to be structured from the beginning. Everybody has started something but a reference design document for the general structure of the code would be useful. We can work, discuss and build on top of this.

= Structure =

We shall only put the suitable _class members_, then data structure can be easily transformed later. Everybody can implement their own _class methods_ separately.  

*core.h*
{{{
class Vector3D
{
    float x, y, z;
}

class Face
{
    vector<int> indices;
}

class Line3D
{
    Vector3D origin, direction;
}

class Rotation3D
{
    float angle, ax, ay, az;
}
}}}

*geometry3d.h*
{{{
struct Material // simple material definition, not "appearance"
{
    Vector3D diffuseColor,
             specularColor,
             ambientIntensity;

    GLuint texture_id; // none: -1
}

class Geometry3D
{
    vector< Vector3D > points, normals, colors;
    vector< vector<Face> > faces;
    Material material;

    vector< Geometry* > children;
    Vector3D translation, scale;
    Rotation3D rotation; 

    void draw();
}
}}}

*scene3d.h*
{{{
class Scene3D
{
    Geometry3D root;
}
